# JOB CIRCULAR MANGAMENT 
An online job circular provides a platform where job seekers can search for job openings, 
and where employers can post job vacancies and find qualified candidates. The goal is to 
create a centralized and efficient system that simplifies the job search and hiring process 
for both job seekers and employers. The project should offer features such as job search 
filters, user profiles, job application tracking, and job posting management. Overall, the 
aim is to create a user-friendly, accessible, and reliable job portal that helps to bridge the 
gap between job seekers and employers. This SRS describes the functional and non
functional requirements of the job portal system, as well as any constraints and 
assumptions that may impact the development process. It outlines the features and 
functionalities of the system and establishes a clear set of criteria for the acceptance and 
evaluation of the final product. While this SRS is intended to provide a comprehensive 
overview of the system, it may not cover every aspect or feature of the job portal. As the 
project evolves, additional requirements may emerge, and the scope of the SRS may need 
to be revised to reflect these changes.
